        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am currently a 2nd year at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Pre-Business. I commute from Riverside, but closer to the Corona area. I figured it would be best for me to stay local in order to save money and stay concentrated in pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Business Administration. <br><br>

        I have been employed since 2017 when I was in high school, working as a sales associate for a retail soccer store in the city of Santa Ana. After countless hours and effort put into the job, I have recently been promoted to part-time manager. As a part time manager, I have more responsibility such as being a shift leader, counting sales, closing registers, and cleaning. I also have to make sure other employees are on task and doing their tasks currently. Due to being the employee with the most experience, I must create a path for the other employees to follow and look out after them. As a shift leader, I have to create a schedule for the week for the other employees. They are only three apart from me, so it isnâ€™t too bad. Once the schedule is planned out, I have to upload into google docs for the others to see. Occasionally, I have to shift around the schedule to fit the needs of the other employees. Apart from a shift leader, I also calculate the sales of the week. After every day, I must report the total sales revenue of the day, along with the number of transactions. After that, I have to count what items were sold and how many of them and update the inventory number. At the end of the week, I add them all up and calculate the total sales revenue of the week. I do the same routine for the card transactions. After every day, I must close the registers and put the money into the safe and leave about 200 dollars of change. Before I close, I have to vacuum since we have carpet. Throughout the day, I have to wipe down all the windows as well as hangers and shoe holders. Along with all that, I have to make sure all sizes are available in display for the customers to purchase. I also take note of anything is missing and put out any new inventory.
<br><br>

        This past few weeks I have been given the responsibility of opening an amazon sellers account to upload all items that are on our sales section. I have to add each barcode into the system of amazon and make sure the correct product is listed. Once the inventory is uploaded into amazon, I have to package all items that were sold for the day and leave them ready for delivery for the next business day if it is past 5 p.m. So far, this job has offered plenty of opportunities to grow as a person as well as a manager to experience new roles in the business world.
